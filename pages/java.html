        </p>
        <p class="text">This console program uses a few arrays and a lot of structure control programming.
            Prompts ask the user to input scores for a 10 frame game of bowling. The scores are
            recorded and calculated to produce a display scoreboard to the players. All of this is done in a console
            program
            and also uses functions for reuse of code.

        <p class="text">Final project in Java to create a Battleship game.
        </p>
        <p class="text">This game was created to run a game in console for Battleship using object oriented programming
            in Java. There were several requirementsfor this project.
            We were only allowed to use a driver program named Battleship and two classes named ActionGame and
            Gameboard. This game prompts the player to input coordinates to a
            grid layout and try to hit the ships on the gameboard that were automatically generated. It will tell you if
            there is a hit or miss and keep track of your hits and
            misses and total number of missiles left. The player has a choice of three gameboard sizes that each have a
            different amount of missles to hit five different sized ships.
            The hits are kept track of and displayed on the gameboard during play.

        <p class="text">This game is played in a graphical user interface. The player places an 'X' or an 'O' in a
            square by clicking a mouse.
            This was made by following along with a video the instructor chose for exposer to how JavaFX works.
